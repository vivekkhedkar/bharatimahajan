                    To start off, I used the LEMErS framework (Learnability, Efficiency, Memorability, Error Management & Satisfaction) to conduct a 
                    heuristic evaluation of existing zoo websites. Not only did I uncover a concerning array of usability problems—ranging from a glitchy 
                    website navigation bar to the confusing and segmented way that content was organized—but also found that the websites had inconsistencies 
                    in look and feel. I later discovered during usability testing that these inconsistencies—although feeling more like a visual design issue—were 
                    actually a user experience problem, too. I analyzed the websites of the Indianapolis Zoo, the St. Louis Zoo, and the Columbus Zoo.

                <p class="div-subtitle">User interviews:</p>
                <p>To get a better real-world understanding of the problem, I underwent two user research methods. Method one was a survey. I received 14 responses 
                    regarding various aspects of the issue. Method two was to conduct several individual interviews with people of varying backgrounds who represent the 
                    target audience. I sent out a screener survey in Qualtrics to learn more about the demographics and habits of my average user. I also researched the 
                    demographic profile of zoo-goers in the U.S. I then developed a discussion guide and observation log to facilitate interviews with zoo-goers. I 
                    conducted 5 user interviews to discover what user pain points were, what their goals were, and to hear about their awesome and not-so-awesome zoo 
                    experiences. Once the interviews were finished, I did an affinity map to extrapolate trends from the research.

                    <P>Users are frustrated that they don’t have an engaging experience upon visiting the mobile website because it looks cluttered. Most of the zoos’ mobile 
                        websites are really just a miniature version of their desktop websites. There is too much information on them that is not useful for a mobile user.

                    <p class="div-subtitle">Sketches</p>
                    <p>From the data I collected, I created an ideal user flow, imagining an optimal user experience for visitors to the Yuba City Zoo website. It later developed 
                        into sketches of an experience map, which captured the user’s journey within the website.
                        From there, I decided what actions and features were crucial and beneficial, and designed a sitemap for the main animal page around these conclusions. I 
                        wanted to create a seamless experience for my target users by emphasizing simplicity, but keeping a balance between categorizing animals based upon their 
                        classes in addition to their habitats, as both options were needed.</p>

                        delighted with how quickly they could find specific animals that were categorized by their respective classes and habitats. A set of wireframes were made 
                        before committing to the final design, taking all these research points into account.</p>

                    <p class="div-title"> MOVING FORWARD </p>
                    <p>There is still a lot more to explore with the Yuba City Zoo. How can the digital experience be translated in the physical space? How can the zoo map be 
                        made interactive to help users navigate in real time? Can I devise other ways to allow zoo-goers to share and review their zoo experiences? These are 
                        just some of the questions I’d like to expand on as I continue to work on this project.</p>
